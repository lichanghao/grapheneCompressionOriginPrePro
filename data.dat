Want to specify the chirality independently? 1 is yes, followed by the angle (0 is zig-zag and 30 is arm-chair)

30.
What potential??
22
Code: 1 is bending, 2 is twisting, 3 is compression with end nodes totally clamped, 4 is compression with only x and 3dofs prescribed, 5 is load at one end and the other fixed, and 6 is squeeze
3
Angle if Code is 1 or 2, and percentage of compression if Code is 3 or 4, and percentage of radius squeeze if Code is 6
